Hi!

Welcome to Rifal & Rana CS50 Final Project - "AROMA” we are Management Information System Junior 2 students in Yanbu University College in Saudi Arabia. We decided to take this course to enhance our resume and what a great way to enhance it and improve our programming skill than CS50 . Our project is called AROMA which means a distinctive, typically pleasant smell . We chose this name because it is inspired by the idea of our project . Our project is a perfumes recommendation system . The idea of the project was chosen based on our country’s most consumed products which is perfumes . In Saudi Arabia , Consumers spent $1.7 billion on perfumes in 2018 with expectations to reach $1.8 billion in 2022 . It is impossible to visit a Saudi house without smelling and seeing perfumes . Especially Oud Tola it is a tradition in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So, we wanted to benefit our community with our system. A demo video (2 minutes) can be found at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEpSuRKUXUg: " AROMA " is a website is useful to those who are searching for perfumes with good prices . Technologies used :

In the upper section of the website’s interface ( navigation bar ) . There is AROMA which is the website’s name , search engine , favorites and dropdown menu . Down in the website interface the user can see a bar for suggested and most popular perfumes . When the user hover on the desired perfume , the name and the fragrance family of it will pop-up . We decided to write the fragrance family of each perfume to make it easy for the user to chose what they want based on their fragrance family preferences whether it is woody, floral or oriental . Those three fragrance family is recommended because they are the most popular and desired smells. When button “ Buy ” is clicked , the website will direct the user to another selling website .
